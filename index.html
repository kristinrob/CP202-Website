          Endinburgh. The first Harry Potter novel was submitted to thirteen publishing houses, 
          all of which rejected the manuscript except one. The decision to publish Rowling's book 
          owes much to the eight-year-old daughter of the publisher's chairman, who was given the 
          first chapter to review by her father and immediately demanded the next. </strong> </p>

    <p class="pb-5"> <strong> The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is located in Scotland, 
      United Kingdom. The school has multiple charms and spells on and around it that 
      make it impossible for a Muggle to locate it. The castle's setting is described as having 
      extensive grounds with sloping lawns, flowerbeds and vegetable patches, a loch called 
      The Black Lake, a large dense forest called the Forbidden Forest, several greenhouses 
      and other outbuildings, and a full-size Quidditch pitch. Quiddich is a famous wizarding 
      sport played on broomsticks. It is the most popular and well-known game among wizards and is 
      Howgarts' most honourable sport. 
      There is also an owlery, which 
      houses all the owls owned by the school and those owned by students. Some rooms in the school 
      tend to "move around", and so do the stairs in the grand staircase. The main way to get to
       Hogwarts from the Muggle world is the Hogwarts Express that students take at the start of 
       each school year. Students board the train from the hidden Platform 9 3/4 at King's Cross 
       station in London. </strong> </p>
